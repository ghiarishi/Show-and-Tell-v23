The overall dataset (approximately 165k images) is about 25GB in size. Thus, we cannot upload the entire dataset to Drive. The data was pre-split, and links to the same can be found below: 

Train Data (118k images): http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip
Val Data (5k images):     http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip
Test Data (41k images):   http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip

Through this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OTaVLAAHYE0SFX1EcoS8YGmmxk2LurTj?usp=sharing) we have shared a few samples of the data. It is primarily structured as an image along with 5 sample human generated captions. There also exists the option to access image segmentation data/labels, if we wish to purely work on the NLP end of the project.
